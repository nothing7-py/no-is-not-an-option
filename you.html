  <h2>Why it should be you — not anyone else ❤️</h2>

  <p>
    Because with you, everything feels honest — the laughs, the quiet moments,
    even the hard days. The messy times turns into laughter,the sad times healed with ur comfort....
  </p>

  <p>
    You don’t just make me happy. You make me feel understood, safe,
    and somehow at home.

    Loving you never felt like a choice. It just happened,
    and it keeps happening every day.I know sometimes'we' messed up but the next we get together.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I imagine my future, it doesn’t make sense without you in it.
  </p>

  <p><strong>
    That’s why it’s you. Always you.And I love you,bubu for eternal.....
